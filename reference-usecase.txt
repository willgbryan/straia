🎯 User Intent
VP of EM wants to know: “Are first-gen commuter students at risk this semester?”
The motivation: “I want to know whether my advising staff should proactively reach out to this group.”

Step-by-Step Demo Script
🟢 Step 1: User Input (Initial Query Form)
User Interface Shows:

👉 Design note for Will: This screen has one large question input, and two required smaller text fields for "Why" and "What are you trying to solve?"
Use placeholder text for hints (e.g., “What’s driving this question?”).

🔵 Step 2: Clarifying Questions (With Teaching Moments)
The system detects ambiguous terms:
“at risk”
“first-gen”
“commuter”
“this semester”
The interface switches to a Clarification UI (chat-style or side panel with quick reply buttons and help tooltips).

2A. Clarify “At Risk”
Prompt:
When you say “at risk,” what outcome are you concerned about?
Options (with tooltips):
🎓 GPA Risk
 Flag students with GPAs below a defined threshold. This helps assess academic performance concerns.
🧭 Engagement Risk
 Looks at LMS activity, advisor check-ins, or missed deadlines. Great for identifying students slipping through the cracks.
🔁 Retention Risk
 Predicts likelihood of student departure based on multi-factor indicators.

2B. Clarify “First-Gen”
Prompt:
Which definition of “first-gen” would you like to use?
Options (tooltips or expandable panel):
🧬 Parent Education Level = No Bachelor’s Degree
 Common federal definition. Based on self-reported parent education.
📄 Self-Identified First-Gen Flag
 If students indicated “first-gen” during application or intake.
🧠 Institutional Custom Logic
 Defined by your data team. May include edge cases.

2C. Clarify “Commuter Student”
Prompt:
How should we define “commuter” students?
Options:
🏠 Students Living Off-Campus
 Residence hall status marked as “off-campus” or “not in university housing.”
🧾 Students with Local ZIP Codes
 Home ZIP within 30 miles of campus (e.g. for urban schools).
📊 Hybrid Method (Recommended)
 Combines housing + ZIP code logic. Captures most commuters accurately.

2D. Clarify “This Semester”
Prompt:
Which term should we use for “this semester”?
Options:
📅 Spring 2025 (in progress)
 Use current registration, attendance, and activity.
📈 Fall 2024 (most recently completed)
 More complete outcomes data is available (grades, retention).

🟣 Step 3: Insight Generation + Output UI
Once all clarifications are complete, Straia generates a summary insight panel with:
🧾 Text Summary:
Insight:
 “First-gen commuter students are currently retaining at 76%, compared to 84% for all undergraduates this semester.
Predictive risk indicators suggest a higher chance of departure, particularly among students who:
Missed 2+ advising check-ins
Have not logged into LMS in past 10 days
Are enrolled in fewer than 12 credit hours.”

📊 Visualization:
Bar chart: Retention by cohort (first-gen commuter vs. all students)
Line chart (optional): Historical retention for first-gen commuter students (last 3 terms)


🧭 Explanation:
“Retention is calculated as re-enrollment in the next consecutive term. Students are defined as first-gen using parent education, and as commuters using a hybrid model (off-campus + ZIP codes).”
✅ Follow-up Options (UI buttons):
[ Save this insight to Notebook ]
[ Export as PDF or PPT ]
[ Share with Collaborator ]
[ Set Alert: Notify me if retention for this cohort drops below 75% next term ]
[ Ask a Follow-Up Question ]

🟡 Step 4: Optional Learning Modal (Teach the User)
A small tooltip or info card says:
💡 You just used a hybrid definition of “commuter students” and selected a predictive retention model. Want to learn more about how this model works or how definitions differ?
